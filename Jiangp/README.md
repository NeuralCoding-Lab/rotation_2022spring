# Introduction

The repository [Jp-17/Coding_learning](https://github.com/Jp-17/Coding_learning) showed what I have learned during this rotation, you can go to that repo for more information.

Here just shows my two little practice using [Allendata](https://allensdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/visual_coding_neuropixels.html).


## Model Learning Practice
[GLM_allen_learn](https://github.com/NeuralCoding-Lab/rotation_2022spring/blob/main/jiang_peng/GLM_allen_learn.ipynb)  Try to use GLM to analysis Allendata, which refer to [this tutorial](https://compneuro.neuromatch.io/tutorials/W1D4_GeneralizedLinearModels/student/W1D4_Tutorial1.html)

[CCA_allen_learn](https://github.com/NeuralCoding-Lab/rotation_2022spring/blob/main/jiang_peng/CCA_allen_learn.ipynb)  Try to use CCA to analysis Allendata, which refer to [this blog](https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2018/07/17/cca/) and [this tutorial](https://github.com/gwgundersen/ml/blob/master/canonical_correlation_analysis.py)
